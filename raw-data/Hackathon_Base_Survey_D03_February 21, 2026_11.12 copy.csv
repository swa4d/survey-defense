As someone who works with climate and public-opinion data, I keep seeing the same pattern: the people most affected—outdoor workers, older adults, and lower-income neighborhoods with less tree cover—often have the fewest resources to adapt. When air-quality alerts or heat spikes happen, even simple routines like walking outside or commuting feel riskier, and the unevenness of that risk becomes hard to ignore. It matters to me personally because I want resilience to be treated like basic infrastructure—shade, cooling centers that are accessible, and clear public messaging—rather than something only some people can “opt into.”

It matters to me because many of the older generation don’t understand how big of an issue it is because during their time the housing market was much more affordable than it is now especially with the rise of inflation.,1.11,96.504,97.214,19,complete,Woman,,1.355,1.355,2.333,1,Yes,0.569,0.981,1.525,3,Asian,,0.738,1.505,2.545,2,2006,,,,,High School Diploma or GED,0.658,1.587,2.64,4,Never married,0.838,0.838,1.25,1,Roman Catholic,0.764,0.764,1.958,1,Moderately important,0.874,0.874,1.517,1,Alaska,0.597,0.597,2.49,1,99516,0.598,0.598,3.001,1,None,0.761,2.261,3.201,3,None,0.931,1.753,2.822,4,Broccoli,,,0.839,0.839,1.381,1,Not sure,0.828,1.228,1.601,2,Strongly disapprove,1.163,1.663,1.671,2,"Other party, please specify",moderate,0.864,1.313,4.146,2,,,Neither,0.9,0.9,1.693,1,Moderate; middle of the road,0.903,1.433,2.443,3,Not enough support,1.002,1.452,1.979,2,Legal in most cases,0.906,0.906,1.533,1,A great deal,0.977,3.227,3.235,3,Somewhat support,2.675,2.675,3.135,1,0,0,0.693,0,Favor somewhat,6.126,8.682,9.231,3,Strongly agree,2.631,3.824,4.87,3,,0,0,0.865,0,0,0.846,0.846,1.441,1,Agree,Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly agree,Strongly disagree,Neither agree nor disagree,Strongly disagree,Agree,Disagree,Strongly agree,Neither agree nor disagree,2.189,20.157,20.997,18,An important but lower priority,1.074,1.074,1.786,1,$11-25,0.91,0.91,1.369,1,YEVRUS,0.564,0.564,3.969,1,Depends,0.703,1.174,1.601,3,Working class,1.075,2.192,2.1,2,30,0.572,0.572,3.06,1,Stop sign,0.085,2.814,3.234,5,Up,0.817,0.817,1.491,1,Worse off,0.94,0.94,1.517,1,Worse off,0.708,0.708,1.233,1,Employed part-time,,0.974,1.484,2.636,2,"Less than $25,000",0.881,0.881,1.508,1,Reducing inflation and the cost of living,0.936,0.936,1.381,1,0,0,10.58,0,,No,0.909,2.221,3.085,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.828,0.828,0.838,1,D-03,swaff@umich.edu,709966604737,valid,6991c343-6765-4d01-80cc-57327c930193,,288,"Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_6_2 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.6 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1",,"2/21/2026, 10:48:40 AM",en-US,America/Detroit,0,0,0,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,6,1483,250,115,0,0,0,14,5,0,0,598,78940,497,394,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,has,has not,has,does not have,"is a democracy, and shows every sign that it will remain a democracy","is not a democracy, and shows no sign of becoming a democracy",has not,does not have,"is not a democracy, and shows no sign of becoming a democracy","He has always had a regular job, but has now been the victim of a work-related injury.","He has never had a regular job, but he is fit and healthy.
